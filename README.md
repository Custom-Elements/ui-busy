# ui-busy

A wait indicator as an element.

## Styling

The element is sized based on the surrounding `font-size` so that it'll line up
properly with surrounding text.

Use the Polymer `::shadow` selector on your style element to set the `fill` CSS
property on `ui-busy`. That will change the color of the bars. Set the `stroke`
too for added confusedness. No, actually, please don't do that.

Check out the demo for an example.
